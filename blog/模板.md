## H

This is my first post on Docusaurus.

A whole bunch of exploration to follow.

Tags File

Use the tags plugin option to configure the path of a YAML tags file.

## 3

By convention, the plugin will look for a tags.yml file at the root of your content folder(s).

This file can contain a list of predefined tags. You can reference these tags by their keys in Markdown files thanks to the tags front matter.

Using a tags file, you can ensure that your tags usage is consistent across your plugin content set. Use the onInlineTags: 'throw' plugin option to enforce this consistency and prevent usage of inline tags declared on the fly.
Types

The YAML content of the provided tags file should respect the following shape:

## 12 {#替代标题}
